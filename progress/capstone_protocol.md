Stakeholder meeting notes:
- One-time data analysis to about job adverts in the US on one day

    - Three different target groups is a "big task", better to have fewer.
    Possible employee include: past bootcamp participants, apprenticeship, self taught, no experience or degree, experience, etc.
    Possible schools include: traditional universities, coding websites, bootcamp organizations, tutors, etc.
    possible employers include: companies doing their own hiring, "head-hunters", etc.

    - What skills to learn -> how to learn then -> what to offer
    - Missing skills?
    - What can I apply for with current skills?
- Look into Natural Language Processing 

Next Steps:
- assess data quality
- how to handle position hierarchies like junior, senior, middle, etc.

### **11. Tuesday 06.12.2022**
**Nuel:**
Stakeholder Meeting:
feature list : how do we intend to accomplish our potential, solution. i.e how do we tell the students which skills to learn.
what do you expect to find
what groups of information do we intend to use.  
mvp: core deliverables that we have to deliver no matter what(most impt part of our project.) scoping, specific as possible
intended to keep = hard skills, soft skills(more specific soft skills) and experience. (employee to job fit)
how to use / intend to turn our scope into knowlegde to be utilized by the stakeholders
job title grouping. (junior, senior ...... )  
expect to see higher years of experience for senior levels. but then we need to have a look at our stake holders.
count how often a skill appears then group by (hard, soft and experience columns) columns.  
More you count implies more important it is.  
Exclude data scientist analyst or data science analyst, ....... or take as a third group and see what the difference is or if the company title preference is a bit screwed... or is there a new title out there.    
Define data analyst and others  with respect to the content of our dataset, creates transparency and trust.
skill weighting (could be done on tableau).  

Most important : turning columns into knowledge.  


Drop Data-Data??   
one Master Dataset ??  

Task??  
work on job title and description keyword and start ranking in the next few days.
